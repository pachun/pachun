Hey, I'm Nick! 👋🏻

I help companies build iOS and Android apps and get them into user's hands quickly. I do fast, quality work and the pace of development does not stop year after year. I practice true test driven development which prevents work from becoming overly complex, allowing us to move confidently fast. I love pairing with developers at all levels and I really enjoy working with React and React Native (❤️ Expo) and Ruby on Rails.

I work on [Untax App](https://untax.app) and [write about my experience developing software](https://pachulski.me) in my spare time.

[Here's some more information about my recent work](http://pachulski.me/about).

[Let me know if you're interested in working together](https://pachulski.me/work-with-me)!
