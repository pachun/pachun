# Hello! 👋🏻 I'm Nicholas Pachulski

I _love_ writing code using practices and tools that promote simplicity.

👫 [Pair Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html)

🧪 [Test Driven Development](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html)

⚛️ [React](https://react.dev) ([Native](https://reactnative.dev) ([Expo](https://expo.dev)))

💎 [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) ([on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org))

💧 [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) ([and Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org))

I spend my time building things that I believe will make people happier and [writing about it](https://pachulski.me). Most days, I do it in exchange for mortgage payments, nice dinners, puppy pampering provisions and hockey pads.

If you have similar sentiments and need help with anything, [please get in touch](https://pachulski.me/work-with-me)!

You'll hear back... I'm an inbox zero guy ✊
